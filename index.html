<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The setting has three components: remote computer, one or more Unix
R-session servers, and a Unix Hadoop cluster. The second two components are
running R and RHIPE.  You work on the remote
computer, say your laptop, and login to an R-session server.
This is home base, where you do all of your programming
of R and RHIPE R commands. The R commands you write for division, anpplication
of analytic methods, and recombination that are destined for Hadoop on the
cluster are passed along by RHIPE R commands.</p>

<p>The remote computer is typically for you to maintain. The R-session
servers  require IT staff to help install software, configure, and maintain. 
However you install packages too on the R-session servers, just you do when you
want to use an R CRAN package in R. There is an extra task though; you want
packages you install to be pushed up the Hadoop cluster so they can be used
there too.  Except for this push by you, the Hadoop cluster is the
domain of the systems administrators who must, among other tasks, install
Hadoop.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='the-r-session-server-and-rstudio'>
<h3>The R-Session Server and RStudio</h3>

<p>Now the R-session server can be separate from the Hadoop cluster, handling
only R sessions, or it can be one of the servers on the Hadoop cluster. If it
is on the Hadoop cluster, there must be some precautions taken in the Hadoop
configuration to protect the programming of the R session. This is needed
because the RHIPE Hadoop jobs compete with the R sessions. There are never full
guarantees though, so &quot;safe mode&quot; is separate R session servers. The last thing
you want is for R sessions to get bogged down. If the cluster option is chosen,
then you want to mount a file server on the cluster that contains the files
associated with the R session such as .RData and files read into to R or
written by R.</p>

<p>There is a vast segment of the R community that uses RStudio, for good reason.
RStudio can join the setting. You have RStudio server  installed on the
R-session servers by system administators. A web browser on the R server runs
the RStudio interface which is accessed by you on your remote device via the
remote login.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='the-remote-computer'>
<h3>The Remote Computer</h3>

<p>The remote computer is just a communication device, and does not carry out data
analysis, so it can run any operating system, such as Windows. This is
especially important for teaching, since Windows labs are typically very
plentiful at academic institutions, but Unix labs much less so.
Whatever the operating system, a common communication protocol that  is used
is the SSH protocol. SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and
execute commands or to transfer files. But a critical capability of it for our
purposes here is that it supports both your R session command-line window,
showing both input and output, and a separate window to show graphics.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='where-are-the-data-analyzed'>
<h3>Where Are the Data Analyzed</h3>

<p>Obviously, much data analysis is carried out by Hadoop on the Hadoop cluster.
Your R commands are given to RHIPE, passed along to Hadoop, and the outputs
are written by Hadoop to the HDFS.</p>

<p>But in many analyses of larger and more complex data, it is common to have
(1) outputs of a recombination method that constitute a relatively small
dataset, and (2) the outputs are further analyzed as part of the overall
analysis. If they are small enough to be readily analyzed in your R session,
then for sure that is where you want to be.
RHIPE commands allow you to write the recombination outputs from the HDFS to
the R global environment of your R session. They become a dataset in .RData.
While programming R and RHIPE is easy, it is not as easy as plain old serial R.
The point is that a lot of data analysis can be carried out in just R even when
the data are large and complex.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='background'>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>You will likely want to install packages on your R
session server, for example, R CRAN packages. And you want these packages to
run on the Hadoop cluster as well. The mechanism for doing this is much like
what you have been using for packages in R, but adds a push of the packages to
the cluster nodes since you will want to use them there too. It is all quite
simple.</p>

<p>Standard R practice for a server with many R users is for a system
administrator to install R for use by all. However, you can
override this by installing your own version. It makes sense to follow this
practice in this setting too, and have the systems administrators install R
and <code>RHIPE</code> on the R session server and the Hadoop cluster.
(The <code>RHIPE</code> installation manual for system administrators is available in
these pages in the QuickStart section.) But you can override this and install
your own <code>RHIPE</code> and R, and push them to
the cluster along with any other packages you installed.
You do need to be careful to check versions of R, <code>RHIPE</code>, and
Hadoop for compatibility. The Tessera GitHub site has this information.</p>

<p>Now suppose you are using RMR on the Amazon cloud or Vagrant, both
discussed in our QuickStart section. Then installation of R
and RHIPE on the R session server and the push to the cluster 
has been taken care of for you. But if you want to install
R CRAN packages or packages from other sources you will need to understand the
installation mechanism.</p>

<p>There are some other installation matters that are the sole domain of the
system administrator. Obviously linux and Hadoop are. But also
protocol buffers must be installed on the Hadoop cluster to enable <code>RHIPE</code>
communication. In addition, if you want to use RStudio on the R session
server, the system administrator will need to install RStudio server on the R
session server. Now there is one caution here for both users and system
administrators to consider.  You are best served if the linux versions you
run are the same on the R server and cluster nodes, and also if the
hardware is the same. The first is more critical, but the second is a
nice bonus.  Part of the reason is that Java plays a critical roll in RHIPE,
and Java likes homogeneity.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='install-and-push'>
<h3>Install and Push</h3>

<p>To install <code>Rhipe</code> on the R session server, you first download the package file
from within R</p>

<pre><code class="r">system(&quot;wget http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/rhipebin/Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>This puts the package in your R session directory.
There are other versions of <code>Rhipe</code>. You will need to go to Github to find out
about them.  To install the package on your R session server, run</p>

<pre><code class="r">install.packages(&quot;testthat&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;rJava&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz&quot;, repos=NULL, type=&quot;source&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>The first two R CRAN packages are used only for <code>RHIPE</code> installation.
You do not need them again until you reinstall.
<code>RHIPE</code> is now installed. Each time you startup an R session and you
want<code>RHIPE</code> to be available, you run</p>

<pre><code class="r">library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you push to the cluster HDFS the software you have installed on the R
session server, choosing from among  R, <code>RHIPE</code> , and other R packages.
First, you need the system administrator to configure the HDFS so
you can do both this and other analysis tasks where you need to write to the
HDFS. You need to have a directory on the HDFS where you have write permission.
A common convention is for the administrator is to set up for you
the directory <code>/yourloginname</code> using your login name, and do the same
thing for other users. We will assume that has happened.</p>

<p>Suppose in <code>/yourloginname</code> you want to create a directory <code>bin</code> on the
HDFS where you will push your installations on the R session server. You can
do this and carry out the push by</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhmkdir(&quot;/yourloginname/bin&quot;)
hdfs.setwd(&quot;/yourloginname/bin&quot;)
bashRhipeArchive(&quot;R.Pkg&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><code>rhmkdir()</code> creates your directory <code>bin</code> in the directory <code>yourloginname</code>.
<code>hdfs.setwd()</code> declares <code>/yourloginname/bin</code> to be the directory with your
choice of installations.  <code>bashRhipeArchive()</code> creates the actual archive of
your installations and names it as <code>MyBin</code>.</p>

<p>Each time your R code will require the installations on the HDFS, you
must in your R session run</p>

<pre><code class="r">library(Rhipe) rhinit()
rhoptions(zips = &quot;/myloginname/bin/R.Pkg.tar.gz&quot;)
rhoptions(runner = &quot;sh ./R.Pkg/library/Rhipe/bin/RhipeMapReduce.sh&quot;)
</code></pre>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='the-data'>
<h3>The Data</h3>

<p>The housing data consist of 7 monthly variables on housing sales from Oct
2008 to Mar 2014, which is 66 months. The measurements are for 2883 counties
in 48 U.S. states, excluding Hawaii and Alaska, and also for the District of
Columbia which we treat as a state with one county.
The data were derived from sales of housing units from Quandl&#39;s Zillow Housing
Data (<a href="http://www.quandl.com/c/housing">www.quandl.com/c/housing</a>).
A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a
single room that is occupied or intended to be occupied  as a
separate living quarter.</p>

<p>The variables are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>FIPS</strong>: FIPS county code, an unique identifier for each U.S. county</li>
<li><strong>county</strong>: county name</li>
<li><strong>state</strong>: state abbreviation</li>
<li><strong>date</strong>: time of sale measured in months, from 1 to 66</li>
<li><strong>units</strong>: number of units sold</li>
<li><strong>list</strong>: monthly median list price (dollars per square foot)</li>
<li><strong>selling</strong>: monthly median selling price (dollars per square foot)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many observations of the last three variables are missing: units 68%, list 7%,
and selling 68%.</p>

<p>The number of measurements (including missing), is 7 x 66 x 2883 = 1,331,946.
So this is in fact a small dataset that could be analyzed in the standard
serial R. However, we can use them to illustate how RHIPE R commands implement
Divide and Recombine. We simply pretend the data are large and complex, break
into subsets, and continuing on with D&amp;R. The small size let&#39;s you easily
pick up the data, follow along using the R commands in the tutorial, and
explore RHIPE yourself with other RHIPE R commands.</p>

<p>&quot;housing.txt&quot; is available in our Tesseradata Github repository of the
<code>RHIPE</code> documentation [here]
The file is a table with 190,278 rows (66 months x 2883 counties) and
7 columns (the variables). The fields in each row are separated by a comma,
and there are no headers in the first line. Here are the first few lines of
the file:</p>

<pre><code>01001,Autauga,AL,1,27,96.616541353383,99.1324

</code></pre>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='write-housingtxt-to-the-hdfs'>
<h3>Write housing.txt to the HDFS</h3>

<p>To get started, we need to make <code>housing.txt</code> available as a text file within
the HDFS file system. This puts it in a place where it can be read into R, form
subsets, and then write them to the HDFS. This is similar to what we do
using R in the standard serial way. If we have a text file to read into R, we
move put it in a place where we can read it into R, for example, in the working
directory of the R session.</p>

<p>The first step, as for the standard R case, is to copy <code>housing.txt</code> to a
directory on the R-session server where your R session is running.
Suppose the path name of this directory is</p>

<pre><code class="r">[1] &quot;/home/myusername/myRdirectory/&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to get <code>housing.txt</code> onto the
HDFS as a text file, so we can read it into R on the cluster.
There are Hadoop commands that could be used directly to copy the file, but
our promise to you is that you never need to use Hadoop commands. There is a
a RHIPE function, <code>rhput()</code> that will do it for you.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhput(&quot;/home/myusername/mydirectory/housing.txt&quot;, &quot;/yourloginname/housing/housing.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument specifies the full linux path of the text file on the R
session server to be copied. The second argument is the path name of a
directory on the HDFS.</p>

<!--
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Recall that this directory is on the initiating R server. Then download the data file to your 
local working directory with the following command:


```r
system("wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaosutong/docs-RHIPE/gh-pages/housing.txt")
```

If it downloaded properly, then "housing.txt" will show up in the output of this command, which lists files
in your local working directory:


```r
list.files(".")
```

This tutorial assumes that you've already installed `RHIPE` using the instructions provided.
Every time we use `RHIPE`, we have to call the `RHIPE` library in R and initialize it.  Your values
for `zips` and `runner` might be different than these, depending on the details of your installation.


```r
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
rhoptions(zips = "/ln/share/RhipeLib.tar.gz")
rhoptions(runner = "sh ./RhipeLib/library/Rhipe/bin/RhipeMapReduce.sh")
```

Now we want to copy the raw text file to the HDFS.  The function that writes files to HDFS is `rhput()`.  
Replace `tongx` with an appropriate HDFS directory, such as your user name.


```r
rhput("./housing.txt", "/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt")
```
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-->

<p>The <code>rhput</code> function takes two arguments.
The first argument is the path to the local file to be copied, and the second argument is the HDFS path where
the file will be written. <code>rhput</code> creates the file at destination, overwriting the destination if
it already exists.
We can also copy files onto HDFS via Hadoop&#39;s command line interface, but
<code>RHIPE</code> allows us to achieve this task from within R.</p>

<p>We can confirm that the housing data text file has been written to HDFS with the <code>rhexists</code> function.
Make sure you specify the same directory as you used in the last step.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhexists(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[1] TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to see more details about a file or directory on HDFS, we can use <code>rhls()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group     size          modtime                            file
1 -rw-rw-rw- tongx supergroup 7.683 mb 2014-09-17 11:11   /ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt
</code></pre>

<p><code>rhls()</code> is very similar to the bash command <code>ls</code>.  It will list all content under a given address. 
We can see that the &quot;housing.txt&quot; file with size 11.82Mb is located under &quot;/ln/tongx/housing/&quot; 
on HDFS.</p>

<p>With our data on the HDFS, we are ready to start a D&amp;R analysis.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='read-and-divide-by-county'>
<h3>Read and Divide by County</h3>

<p>As we showed previously, we divided the whole data set to subsets by state, and then calculated the mean list
and selling price for each state. According to different purpose of the data analysis, we sometime would
like to divide the data set by different variables. So we are going to show that what if we divide our housing
data by county from the text file as well.</p>

<p>The input keys are line numbers in the housing data text file.  They are the elements of the list
object <code>map.keys</code>.  The input values are the lines of text, which are the elements of the list object <code>map.values</code>.
This is the default when the input is a raw text file.  For each input key-value pair, <code>rhcollect</code> emits an
intermediate key-value pair, where the key is the state name (the third field in the comma-separated
line) and the value is all other fields in the line, stored as a data frame with a single row.</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map3 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    line = strsplit(map.values[[r]], &quot;,&quot;)[[1]]
    key &lt;- line[1:3]
    value &lt;- as.data.frame(rbind(line[c(-1, -2, -3)]), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    names(value) &lt;- c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;units&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;selling&quot;)
    value$list &lt;- as.numeric(value$list)
    value$selling &lt;- as.numeric(value$selling)
    rhcollect(key, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we want to use the FIPS code as a unique identifier for the county, since counties in
different states can share a common name.  This time we&#39;ve used a character vector of length 3
as the key.  It contains the unique FIPS code, the county name, and the state name.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce3 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    oneCounty &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    oneCounty &lt;- rbind(oneCounty, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    attr(oneCounty, &quot;county&quot;) &lt;- reduce.key[2]
    attr(oneCounty, &quot;state&quot;) &lt;- reduce.key[3]
    rhcollect(reduce.key[1], oneCounty)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>By removing the FIPS, county, and state columns from the data frame and storing them as
attributes, we&#39;ve eliminated redundant information in each data frame. Working with massive 
data sets, we want our data to take up the least possible space on disk in order to save 
read/write time. Also we only keep the first element in <code>reduce.key</code> which is the <code>FIPS</code>
as the key in output key/value pairs.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">mr3 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map3,
  reduce   = reduce3,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byCounty&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  readback = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>After the job completes successfully, we&#39;ll read the results from HDFS into our interactive R 
session as we did before.  This time, let&#39;s use the <code>max</code> argument to <code>rhread</code>, which specifies 
how many key-value pairs to read. The default value is -1, which means read in all key-value pairs.</p>

<pre><code class="r">countySubsets &lt;- rhread(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byCounty&quot;, max = 10)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Read 10 objects(31.39 KB) in 0.04 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose we want to see all 10 keys that we read.  Recall that key-value pairs are stored as a nested
list.  So what we want is the first element of each element in the list.  We can use <code>lapply</code> to get
them:</p>

<pre><code class="r">keys &lt;- unlist(lapply(countySubsets, &quot;[[&quot;, 1))
keys
</code></pre>

<pre><code> [1] &quot;01013&quot; &quot;01031&quot; &quot;01059&quot; &quot;01077&quot; &quot;01095&quot; &quot;01103&quot; &quot;01121&quot; &quot;04001&quot; &quot;05019&quot; &quot;05037&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let&#39;s check that we have the FIPS code, state name, and county name information saved as 
attributes of the data frame.</p>

<pre><code class="r">attributes(countySubsets[[1]][[2]])
</code></pre>

<h3>Compute County Means</h3>

<p>We calculate the mean list price and mean sale price by county exactly the same way we 
calculated them by state. </p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map4 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    value &lt;- data.frame(
      listMean = mean(map.values[[r]]$list, na.rm = TRUE),

      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    value$state &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;state&quot;)
    value$county &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;county&quot;)
    value$FIPS &lt;- map.keys[[r]]
    rhcollect(1, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>In the map expression, we create a single row data frame for each county. The data frame has five
columns: FIPS, listMean, saleMean, state, and county name. FIPS code, state name, and county name 
can be found in the attributes of each element of <code>map.values</code>. In order to combine all means by
county into one data frame, we will assign 1 to be the key for all intermediate key-value pairs.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce4 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    countyMeans &lt;- data.frame()

  reduce = {
    countyMeans &lt;- rbind(countyMeans, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    rhcollect(reduce.key, countyMeans)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>We can use the same reduce expression which we used to find the means by state. The final output
consists of one key-value pair, where the key is 1, and value is the data frame with all county
means.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">meansByCounty &lt;- rhwatch(

  mapred   = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 1
  ),
  readback = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<p>This time we specify only one reduce task by setting <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code> to be 1.
Since we know there is only one
key-value pair in the output, we only need one output file. Eliminating unnecessary output files 
can speed up this job and future jobs which read its output.</p>

<div class='tab-pane' id='introduction-of-the-single-run-of-the-performance'>
<h3>Introduction of the Single Run of the Performance</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll demonstrate the computation ability of <code>RHIPE</code> package with a performance test by using logistic
regression. </p>

<p>The basic idea is firstly, we wish to generate an observation sample with a size of N, V number 
of variables, which means there are \(V-1\) explanatory variables. In summary, we wish to generate a 
dataframe with N rows and V collumns. Secondly, we want to use the logistic regression method to
analyze the dataframe. However, when the data size is quite large, it will be impractical to generate
and analyse the whole data set in terms of the time cosuming and the memory limitation.</p>

<p>Instead, we will use <code>RHIPE</code> package to generate subsets first and then use logistic regression 
method to analyze each subset by R function <code>glm.fit</code>. The subset observation sample size is M and
the number of subsets is R. As a result, \(N = MR\). Each subset contains a sub-dataframe with M rows 
and V collumns. We will use R function <code>system.time</code> to measure elapsed time. We introduce &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
and &quot;v&quot; here, where \(n = log2(N)\), \(m = log2(M)\), and \(v = log2(V)\).</p>

<p>There are two types of elapsed-time computation. The subsets are stored on the HDFS as R objects. 
The first computation type is &quot;O&quot;, the elapsed time to read the subsets from the HDFS and make 
them available to <code>glm.fit</code> in memory as an R objects. The other type, &quot;L&quot;, starts when &quot;O&quot; ends
and it consists of <code>glm.fit</code> computations on the subsets by <code>map</code>, plus `reduce gathering the 
subset estimates and computing the means. However, we cannot measure &quot;L&quot; directly. So we measure 
&quot;O&quot; in one run and \(T = O + L\) in another.</p>

<p>In this example, we will show how to do a sing run of the performance test, which means we only pick
one possible value of &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;v&quot; to see how fast it is to go. </p>

<ul>
<li>n   : 27</li>
<li>m   : 12</li>
<li>v   : 5</li>
<li>rep : 1</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='a-small-slow-and-old-cluster'>
<h3>A Small, Slow and Old Cluster</h3>

<p>The cluster here is a very small and old one with two nodes, each a Dell 1950. One runs NameNode and
the other runs JobTracker. Both run Hadoop DataNode and TaskTracker, and each has</p>

<ul>
<li>Dual 2.33GHz 4-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5410 processors (8 cores)</li>
<li>32 GB memory</li>
<li>2TB disk in SAS-RAID</li>
<li>1 Gbps Ethernet interconnect</li>
</ul>

<p>Collectively, the cluster has 16 cores, 64GB total memory, 4TB disk. The processors are back to 2009,
which are very old. We will see the computation ablity of <code>RHIPE</code> in this small, slow and old cluster.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='generate-dataset'>
<h3>Generate Dataset</h3>

<p>The size for the whole dataset is \(2^{27} \cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3 = 32GB\). We will generate each subset 
with the size of \(2^{12} \cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3 = 1MB\)</p>

<p>As we mentioned in the housing data example, the first step in a D&amp;R analysis is to choose a 
division method and create subsets. In this example, we devide the whole dataset to R sets, where
\(log2(R) = 15\). So we will generate 2<sup>15</sup> dataframes with 2<sup>12</sup> rows and 2<sup>5</sup> columns each. </p>

<p>Before we run the map function, we will set up some basic parameters in the front end of R enviroment:</p>

<pre><code class="r">n   &lt;- 27
m   &lt;- 12
v   &lt;- 5
p   &lt;- 2^v - 1
rep &lt;- 1
</code></pre>

<p>Here we define an R object called <code>p</code>, the value of which equals to \(2^v - 1\). As introduced in the
last part, \(2^v\) is the number of variables, so <code>p</code> is the number of the explanatory variables. We 
introduce <code>p</code> here to make the following codes much easier to write and understand. We also specify
the replicate value <code>rep</code> is 1 because we only have a single run of the cluster performance test. But
in your future performance test, you might want to have more replicates for the test, and you can
easily change the value of <code>rep</code>, we will talk about it later.</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map1 &lt;- expression({
  for (r in map.values){
    set.seed(r)
    value &lt;- matrix(c(rnorm(m*p), sample(c(0,1), m, replace=TRUE)), ncol=p+1)
    rhcollect(r, value)
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we don&#39;t have an existing data which is different from the housing data example. 
Creating a dataset by randomly simulation is the part of the <code>map</code> job. The input keys and values are
the same by default for the sumulating data step. The keys are numeric numbers 1, 2, ...., R,  where
R is the number of the subsets. In our example, \(log2(R) = log2(N/M) = 15\). They are the elements of
the list object <code>map.keys</code>, which in this case, <code>map.keys</code> and <code>map.values</code> would be the same. The 
output keys from the <code>map1</code> function are the same as the input keys. This is defined by the <code>map1</code> 
function. The output value for each key is a matrix with \(2^{13}\) rows and \(2^5\) columns. As we have
explained in the housing data example, the output key-value pairs from the <code>map</code> function 
are also called intermediate key-value pairs. So <code>rhcollect</code> emits these intermediate key-value 
pairs.</p>

<p>There is no reducer step for the generation part. Next we will write the generated subsets to HDFS.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">dir.dm  = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/dm/n27v5m12&quot;
mr1 &lt;- rhwatch(
 map      = map1,
 input    = c(2^(n-m),12),
 output   = dir.dm,
 jobname  = dir.dm,
 mapred   = list(
   mapred.task.timeout=0,
   mapred.reduce.tasks=0),
 parameters = list(m = 2^m, p = p),
 readback = FALSE
  )
</code></pre>

<p>We have introduced the <code>rhwatch</code> function before. In this case, <code>rhwatch</code> function will submit our 
MapReduce jobs to finish the data generation part and write the subsets to HDFS. There are three types
of the <code>input</code> as Text file input, Sequence file input and lapply input. The first two types of input
have been introduced in the housing data example. And in our performance example, the type of 
<code>input</code> is lapply input because we are generating numeric data. The argument <code>input</code> in our 
performance test example is a vector consisting of two elements. The first element specifies the 
input key would be from 1 to \(2^{(n-m)}\) for <code>map1</code> function. Also, it specifies how many tasks you 
would like Hadoop MapReduce Framework to run because each task conresponds to one key-value pair. 
In our performance test example, each task is to generate a subset with 2<sup>13</sup> rows and 2<sup>5</sup> columns. 
The second element of the vector <code>input</code> specifies the numbers of mappers you would like to use. So 
each mapper would run \(2^{(n-m)}/12\) tasks, where <code>12</code> is the value of the second element of <code>input</code>. 
So the value of the second element would definitely affect the performance test and it is worthy to 
carry out an experiment to test its effect. </p>

<p>The argument <code>parameters</code> passes all the possible values we will need in the Hadoop MapReduce jobs 
to HDFS. In our case, we specify the values of <code>m</code> and <code>p</code> in the front end R, but Hadoop doesn&#39;t 
have these values in the back end. So the argument <code>parameter</code> will packages <code>m</code> and <code>p</code> as a list 
and distribute it to HDFS.</p>

<p>The argument <code>jobname</code> is not neccesary to be set. It is the name of the job, which is visible on 
the Jobtracker website. If not provided, Hadoop MapReduce uses the default name job_date_time_number
e.g. job_201007281701_0274.</p>

<h3>Elapsed Time Measurement</h3>

<p>As we has talked in the introduction, we will measure the first elapsed time &quot;O&quot; in one run and 
measure the whole elapsed time &quot;T&quot; in another run.</p>

<h4>The First Kind Of Elapsed Time -- <strong>O</strong></h4>

<pre><code class="r">timing   &lt;- data.frame()
type  &lt;- &quot;O&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>First, we will initialize a data frame called <code>timing</code> to store these two different kinds of elapsed
time later and create a character <code>type</code> to lable &quot;O&quot; and &quot;T&quot; seperately. </p>

<h5>Map</h5>

<pre><code class="r">map2 &lt;- expression({})
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to notice that <code>map2</code> is an expression with no command. That&#39;s because we only want
to read the data from HDFS to the front end without other operations and then record the reading time .</p>

<h5>Execution Function</h5>

<pre><code class="r">dir.dm  &lt;- &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/dm/n27v5m12&quot;
dir.nf  &lt;- &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/nf/n27v5m12&quot;
mr2 &lt;- rhwatch(
 map      = map2,
 input    = dir.dm,
 output   = dir.nf,
 jobname  = dir.dm,
 mapred   = list(
   mapred.reduce.tasks=0,
   rhipe_map_buff_size=2^15),
 parameters = list(p = p),
 noeval   = TRUE,
 readback = FALSE
  )
t      &lt;- as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr2, async=FALSE)})[3])
t      &lt;- data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
timing &lt;- rbind(timing,t)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Saving 1 parameter to /tmp/rhipe-temp-params-c677abd27e3b1654c25dccadaa7e3483 (use rhclean to delete all temp files)

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>noeval</code> is another very useful argument for <code>rhwatch</code>. By default it is set to be &#39;FALSE&#39;.
In our example, we set <code>noeval</code> equals to &#39;TRUE&#39;, which means the  Hadoop MapReduce job will not run,
and <code>rhwatch</code> just return an R object that contains all the information required by Rhipe to run a 
MapReduce job. Instead, the <code>rhex</code> function will submit the MapReduce job to the Hadoop MapReduce 
framework. </p>

<p>The <code>dir.dm</code> and <code>dir.nf</code> specify the <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> argument of <code>rhwatch</code> function. 
So the first <code>t</code> in the R codes records the first type elapsed time O and the second <code>t</code> is a 
data frame which saves the value of computation <code>type</code>, the value of <code>n</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>v</code>, the number of 
replicate <code>rep</code>, and the value of first type of elapsed time O. Then we use R function <code>rbind</code> 
to combine data frame <code>timing</code> and data frame <code>t</code> by rows. We can take a look at the data frame 
<code>timing</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">timing
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  rep  n  m v type       t
1   1 27 12 5    O 253.237
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>timing</code> is a data frame with 1 row and 6 collumns. We will save another type of elapsed time &quot;T&quot;
into this data frame.</p>

<h4>The Second Kind of Elapsed Time -- <strong>T</strong></h4>

<pre><code class="r">type  &lt;- &quot;T&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>We first specify the value of <code>type</code> as <code>T</code> to identify the second kind of elapsed time &quot;T&quot;.</p>

<h5>Map</h5>

<pre><code class="r">map3 &lt;- expression({
 for (v in map.values) {
  value = glm.fit(v[,1:p],v[,p+1],family=binomial())$coef
  rhcollect(1, value)
 }
})
</code></pre>

<p>The input to our <code>map3</code> is the final output we created in the previous section which the key is from
1 to \(2^{15}\) and the input value is a dataframe with \(2^{12}\) rows and \(2^5\) collumns. For each subset,
we apply the same action : take the coefficient of the logistic regression for the subset. They are 
stored in a single row dataframe to be recombined in the reduce step below. This single row dataframe
has <code>p</code> collumns. We use the same key for all the subsets so that they wil appear together in the 
reduce step. As before, <code>rhcollect</code> emits intermediate key-value pairs.</p>

<h5>Reduce</h5>

<pre><code class="r">reduce3 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    v = rep(0,p) 
    nsub = 0
  },
  reduce = {
    v = v + colSums(matrix(unlist(reduce.values), ncol=p, byrow=TRUE)) 
    nsub = nsub + length(reduce.values)
  },
  post = {
   rhcollect(reduce.key, v/nsub)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>In the reduce step, we recombine the coefficients from different subset together and sum them up by 
collumn using R function <code>colSums</code> and and get the estimate of the coefficients by the sample mean.</p>

<p>The input key is the placeholder value 1, which is left unchanged as the output key. The input values
are the single row data frames for each subset, and the output values is the single row data frames
consisting of the mean estimate for the coefficients. In <code>post</code>, we use <code>rhcollect</code> to emit the final
output so that it will be written to HDFS.</p>

<h5>Exectution Function</h5>

<pre><code class="r">dir.dm  = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/dm/n27v5m12&quot;
dir.gf  = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/gf/n27v5m12&quot;

mr3 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map3,
  reduce   = reduce3,
  input    = dir.dm,
  output   = dir.gf,
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks=1,
    rhipe_map_buff_size=10
  ),
 parameters = list(p=p),
 jobname    = dir.gf,
 noeval     = TRUE
)

t &lt;- as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr3, async=FALSE)})[3])
t = data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
timing = rbind(timing,t)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Saving 2 parameters to /tmp/rhipe-temp-params-48fd3131fbae41b13c97ce71393f8aaa (use rhclean to delete all temp files)

</code></pre>

<p>After the job completes successfully, we record the whole elapsed time &quot;T&quot; and save it to the R 
object <code>t</code>. And we save the results to our data frame <code>timing</code>. Till now, we have finished the single
run of the cluster performance test and save the result to a data frame called <code>timing</code>.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='result'>
<h3>Result</h3>

<pre><code class="r">timing
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  rep  n  m v type       t
1   1 27 12 5    O 253.237
2   1 27 12 5    T 561.081

</code></pre>

<p>As we can see from the <code>timing</code> dataframe, there are 2 rows and 6 collumns. The last collumn is the 
elapsed time <code>t</code>. As we can see, the elapsed time &quot;O&quot; we need to read the datasets 
from HDFS to the front end is 253.237 seconds which is about 4.2 mins and the whole elapsed time &quot;T&quot; 
which consists of the reading time and the analyzing time is 561.081 seconds, which is less than 9.4
mins. That result is impressive! The cluster to run the test here is a very small one with two nodes
and 64 GB memory in total. You can definitely use <code>RHIPE</code> computation environment to generalize this 
one single run to a full cluster performance test. We will show you the basic idea about how to run a 
multi-factor experiment for the cluster performance in the next section.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='introduction'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Actually, the elapsed time depends on many factors. This presents an opportunity for optimizing the 
computation even further by making the best choice of the factor. Our approach to the optimization 
is to run statistically designed experiments. This experiment consists of a lot of factors. There are
two different types of elapsed time, which means there is one computation-type categorical factor. 
Three statistical factors  are &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, which are the kernel factors for our experiment. 
There are also two Hadoop HDFS factors and two Hadoop MapReduce factors, two hardware factors. In 
total, we have 10 factors. We also have replicates for each combination of these factors. For more 
details, you can check the paper(link) which describes the whole experiment process. In this tutorial,
we mainly focus on the computation-type category factor &quot;type&quot; and the three statistical factors &quot;n&quot;, 
&quot;m&quot; and &quot;v&quot;.</p>

<p>We will vary the values of <code>n</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>v</code> and set 3 replicates for the experiment. </p>

<ul>
<li>n    : 21, 23, 25, 27</li>
<li>m    : 8, 9, 10, ..., 16</li>
<li>v    : 4, 5, 6</li>
<li>type : &quot;O&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, two levels</li>
<li>rep  : 3</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, we will run a serial computation in R, which means there is no parallel computing. By contrast,
another designed experiment with tessera computation system will be carried out to check the 
computation ablity of tessera. </p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='serial-computation-in-r'>
<h3>Serial Computation in R</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s see what we can do without tessera computation environment, and we only run this experiment in
R. Let&#39;s just try one single run first to have a basic idea about the time costing.</p>

<pre><code class="r">m     &lt;- 2^23
v     &lt;- 5
p     &lt;- 2^v -1
value &lt;- matrix(c(rnorm(m*p), sample(c(0,1), m, replace=TRUE)), ncol=p+1)
L     &lt;- system.time(glm.fit(value[,1:p],value[,p+1],family=binomial())$coef)[3]
rm(value)
L
</code></pre>

<p>We illustrate the serial computation in R by setting the number of observations \(m = 2^{23}\), the 
log2 number of variables \(v = 5\). The size of the dataset is \(2^{23}\cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3=2GB\). Since 
we run this serial computation in R, we don&#39;t need the reading time. That is, we can directly analyze
the dataset after we generate it. In this case, the elapsed time would be the second elapsed time 
&quot;L&quot; which is the analysing time. </p>

<pre><code>367.719
</code></pre>

<p>The total elapsed time \(L =367.719\), the unit for <code>L</code> is second. So it will take about 6.13 mins to 
finish the analyising part. That&#39;s not bad. What if we enlarge the value of <code>v</code> to 6? Then the size
of the new dataset would be \(2^{23}\cdot 2^6 \cdot 2^3=4GB\). We can re-run this test.</p>

<pre><code class="r">v     &lt;- 6
p     &lt;- 2^v -1
value &lt;- matrix(c(rnorm(m*p), sample(c(0,1), m, replace=TRUE)), ncol=p+1)
L     &lt;- system.time(glm.fit(value[,1:p],value[,p+1],family=binomial())$coef)[3]
rm(value)
L
</code></pre>

<pre><code>962.317
</code></pre>

<p>The total elapsed time <code>L</code> is 962.317 seconds, which is approximately 16.04 minutes. So <code>L</code> increases
by about 2 times while the size of dataset increases by 1 time. That is getting crazy. Let&#39;s keep 
going on by change the value of <code>m</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">m     &lt;- 2^25
v     &lt;- 5
p     &lt;- 2^v -1
value &lt;- matrix(c(rnorm(m*p), sample(c(0,1), m, replace=TRUE)), ncol=p+1)
L     &lt;- system.time(glm.fit(value[,1:p],value[,p+1],family=binomial())$coef)[3]
rm(value)
L
</code></pre>

<pre><code>1815.752
</code></pre>

<p>The number of rows is \(2^{25}\) and the number of collumns is \(2^5\). So the size for the new dataset
is \(2^{25}\cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3=8GB\). The elapsed time <code>L</code> is 1815.752 seconds, which is about 30.3 
minutes. What if we keep increasing the size of the dataframe by setting \(m = 2^{27}\) and \(v=4\)? In
this case, the size of the dataset is 16GB. And actually, we will get an error message in the 
analysing step:</p>

<pre><code>Error: cannot allocate vector of size 15.0 Gb
Timing stopped at: 237.267 102.842 416.989

</code></pre>

<p>Same situation happens when we set \(m = 2^{25}\) and \(v=6\) in which case, the data set size is 16GB, 
too. So Serial Computation in R has a lot of limitations in large data analysis such as timing 
costing and memory limitation. </p>

<h4>Conclusion and Plot</h4>

<ul>
<li>For \(v=4\), the largest value of n that it works for Serial Computation in R is 25</li>
<li>For \(v=5\), the largest value of n that it works for Serial Computation in R is 25</li>
<li>For \(v=6\), the largest value of n that it works for Serial Computation in R is 23.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="./plots/serial_v_n.pdf">Plot. Elapsed time plots against n</a>.</p>

<p>And it is time for us to experience the computation ablity of <code>RHIPE</code>.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='a-designed-experiment-using-rhipe'>
<h3>A Designed Experiment Using RHIPE</h3>

<p>We have shown how to run a single run of the performance test, so we 
can easily generalize the single run to the whole cluster performance experiment.</p>

<h4>Generation Datasets Example</h4>

<pre><code class="r">n.vec   &lt;- c(21,23,25,27)
m.vec   &lt;- seq(8, 16, by=1)
v.vec   &lt;- 4:6
p.vec   &lt;- 2^v.vec - 1
run.vec &lt;- 3
dir.exp &lt;- &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>First, we specify some parameters in the frond end of R. The <code>run.vec</code> denotes for each combination 
of <code>m</code>,<code>v</code>, we have 3 replicates. The <code>dir.exp</code> specifies the directory for this experiment on HDFS.</p>

<h5>Map and Execution Function</h5>

<pre><code class="r">for (n in n.vec){
 for (m in m.vec) {
  for (p in p.vec) {
    dir.dm = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/dm/&quot;,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;p&#39;,p,&#39;m&#39;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
    map1
    mr1
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>map1</code> and <code>mr1</code> are the map function and the execution function seperately we write in the datasets 
generation part of the single run example. You can just copy the codes from the last section there.
For each fixed value of <code>m</code> and <code>p</code> there is a single run. So the idea is to put the single run code
to a for-loop. And the for-loop contains multi-number of MapReduce jobs. The <code>dir.dm</code> specifies the 
output location for each MapReduce job. </p>

<p>It is noteworthy that we only generate subsets once and in the following timing part, we would read
the subsets from HDFS to the front end of R 3 times. </p>

<h5>Elapsed Time Measurement</h5>

<pre><code class="r">for (n in n.vec){
 for (rep in rep.vec) {

  ## timing for O
  type = &quot;O&quot;
  for (m in m.vec) {
    for (v in v.vec) {
      dir.dm = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/dm/&quot;,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      dir.nf = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/nf/&quot;,&quot;rep&quot;,rep,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      map2
      mr2
      t      = as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr2, async=FALSE)})[3])
      t      = data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
      timing = rbind(timing,t) 
    }
  }
  ## timing for T
  type = &quot;T&quot;
   for (m in m.vec) {
    for (v in v.vec) {
      dir.dm = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/dm/&quot;,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      dir.gf = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/gf/&quot;,&quot;rep&quot;,rep,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      mp3
      reduce3
      mr3
      t      = as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr3, async=FALSE)})[3])
      t      = data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
      timing = rbind(timing,t)   
    }
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first for-loop stands for the different values of <code>n</code>. For each fixed value of <code>n</code>, the second 
for-loop stands for the replicates. For each fixed value of <code>n</code> and <code>rep</code>, the third and forth 
for-loop is for differente combination of <code>m</code> and <code>v</code>. There is a single run of performance test for
any fixed <code>n</code>, <code>rep</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>v</code>. <code>dir.dm</code> and <code>dir.nf</code> seperately specify the input type and output
type for execution function <code>mr2</code>. The <code>dir.dm</code> and <code>dir.gf</code> seperately specify the input type and 
output type for execution function <code>mr3</code>. The <code>map2</code>, <code>map3</code>, <code>reduce3</code> are the map and reduce 
function we specified before.</p>

<p>Finally, we save our final results to a data frame called <code>timing</code>.</p>

<h4>Results of the Experiment of the Performance Test</h4>

...

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>timing</code> dataframe has 648 rows and 6 collumns because <code>n</code> has 4 different values, <code>type</code> has two
levels, <code>m</code> has 9 different values and <code>v</code> has 3 different values. For each combination of the 
factors, we have 3 replicates. So we have \(4\cdot 2\cdot 9\cdot 3\cdot 3=648\) rows. </p>

<h4>Save the Results to the local</h4>

<p>Because the size of data frame <code>timing</code> is not very large, we can easily download the dataset to
our local laptop.</p>

<pre><code class="r">save(timing, file=paste(&quot;timing&quot;, &quot;.RData&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>First, we saved <code>timing</code> to the R current working directory on initiating 
R server by using <code>save</code> function. Then we will copy this file from the server to our laptop or 
desktop computer. We are assuming that your laptop is running Linux OS. So from now no we will
working in the R that is running on your local laptop.</p>

<pre><code class="r">system(scp song273@deneb.stat.purdue.edu:timing.RData /home/song273/elapsedtime/)
</code></pre>

<p>The linux command <code>scp</code> will copy the <code>timing.RData</code> file from the remote host cluster to the laptop
directory &quot;/home/song273/elapsedtime/&quot;. Then we can analyze the data in our local computer which 
gives us more freedom to analysis, for examle we don&#39;t need to worry about the abrupt network fault.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='visualize-the-results'>
<h3>Visualize the Results</h3>

<p>Here we use R function <code>xyplot</code> in the <code>lattice</code> package to visualize the results. </p>

<pre><code class="r">library(lattice)
load(&quot;timing.RData&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>First, we load the library <code>lattice</code> and load the .RData file to our working console. Now, the data
frame <code>timing</code> is available in our working directory.</p>

<pre><code class="r">v = c(&quot;v=4&quot;,&quot;v=5&quot;,&quot;v=6&quot;)
label = levels(as.factor(v))
xyplot(log2(t)~timing$m|n*type, 
       data   = timing,
       type   =&quot;p&quot;,
       groups = as.factor(timing$v),
       aspect = 2,
       col    = 1:3,
       pch    = 1,
       key    = list(type = c(&quot;p&quot;),
                     text = list(label = label, cex = 1.2),
                     lines = list(col = 1:3, lwd = 1.5, pch=1),
                     column = 3,
                     space = &quot;top&quot;),
       xlab = &quot;Log Number of Observations per Subset (log base 2 number)&quot;,
       ylab = &quot;Log Time (log base 2 sec)&quot;
)
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, we get the first plot: Elapsed time against m. The R code to generate the other plots are
the same.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and log subsets size <code>m</code>.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_m_v.pdf">Plot1. Elapsed time plots against m</a>.</p>

<p>As we can see from the first plot, for every fixed value of <code>n</code> and <code>v</code>, the total elapsed time 
&quot;T&quot; decreases first and then increases later as the value of <code>m</code> changes. And the three different
curves in one pannel show the same drop-increase pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>The second plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and log number of 
varibales <code>v</code>.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_v_n.pdf">Plot2. Elapsed time plots against v</a>.</p>

<p>As we can see from the plot2, for fixed value of <code>m</code> , as the value of <code>v</code> increases, the value 
of log2(elapsed time) increases linearly in each panel of the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>The third plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and log observations <code>n</code>.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_n_v.pdf">Plot3. Elapsed time plots against n</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The forth plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and 3 replicates.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_rep_v.pdf">Plot4. Elapsed time plots against Replicates</a>.</p>

<p>This plots helps to see whether replication has blocking effect on the elapsed time. Because R has 
temporary memory and we read the subsets from HDFS to the front end of R for the first time and R 
has temperory memory about these files and in the next replicate of reading part, R maybe just 
reads these subsets from memory instead of reading them from the HDFS, which will affect our 
elpased time experiment.</p>

<p>From the plot4, we can see that replication doesn&#39;t have the blocking effects.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='summary'>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>We contrast the resulsts in the Serial Computation in R and the Divide and Recombine Computation 
with <code>RHIPE</code>. </p>

<p><a href="./plots/contrast_D_S.pdf">Plot. Elapsed time plots against v</a>.</p>

<p>For each combination of <code>n</code> and <code>v</code>, we pick up the optimal <code>m</code> in the Divid and Recombine
Computation to get the minimum elapsed time &quot;T&quot;. In this plot, we contrast the minimum elapsed time
&quot;T&quot; in Divide and Recombine and the elapsed time &quot;T&quot; in the Serial Computation in R. In this plot,
the categorical factor <code>compute</code> has two levels, &#39;D&#39; and &#39;S&#39;. The &#39;D&#39; stands for the Divide and 
Recombine computation type. And the &#39;S&#39; stands for the Serial Computation type.</p>

<p>As we can see from the plot, the Divid and Recombine Computation by RHIPE has much more prevailing 
advantages than the Serial Computation in R in the aspect of computation speed as well as the 
computation ablity. </p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='manage-rhipe-jobs'>
<h3>Manage RHIPE Jobs</h3>

<p>As you submit more <code>RHIPE</code> jobs, you&#39;ll need to check their status and manage them.  In this short
section, we&#39;ll introduce two new functions to do just that. </p>

<p>First, let&#39;s submit a simple job:</p>

<pre><code class="r">map13 &lt;- expression(
  while(TRUE) {}
)
mr13 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map13,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/housing.txt&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/tmp&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 0
  ),
  readback = FALSE,
  noeval   = TRUE
)
badjob &lt;- rhex(mr13, async = TRUE) 
</code></pre>

<p>We&#39;ve set <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code> to be 0, because this job omits the optional reduce expression.<br>
The map contains an infinite loop, so this job will never complete. The only purpose for this meaningless
map expression is we want the job is keeping running when we try to access its status. But since we&#39;ve run
this job on the backgroup, we can check its status with <code>rhstatus</code>, which takes as an argument
the object returned by <code>rhex</code>. When we said background, it means that the job is running on the 
Hadoop, and we still have the control ability of R session at the same time. </p>

<pre><code class="r">rhstatus(badjob)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[Tue Sep 30 00:34:20 2014] Name:2014-09-30 00:34:05 Job: job_201405301308_4753  State: RUNNING Duration: 14.673

</code></pre>

<p>Type <code>ctrl+c</code> to stop the status updates.  Since we know this job won&#39;t ever complete, 
we&#39;ll have to kill it.  Again, use the object returned by <code>rhex</code></p>

<pre><code class="r">rhkill(badjob)
</code></pre>

<p>You can call <code>rhstatus</code> again to see that the job is now in state <code>KILLED</code></p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='hdfs-file-mangement'>
<h3>HDFS File Mangement</h3>

<p>We can delete, move and copy files on HDFS by using diffferent <code>RHIPE</code> functions, and we 
will illustrate how to do them in the following session.</p>

<p>We can use <code>rhls()</code> to see that what we&#39;ve already had in the <code>/yourloginname/housing</code> direcotry:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/yourloginname/housing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group     size          modtime                                  file
1 drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup        0 2014-10-02 14:29       /yourloginname/housing/byCounty
2 drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup        0 2014-09-20 11:16   /yourloginname/housing/meanByCounty
3 -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup 7.683 mb 2014-09-17 11:11    /yourloginname/housing/housing.txt
</code></pre>

<p>We can delete a direcoty or a file with the <code>rhdel()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhdel(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/byCounty&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>And we can use <code>rhls</code> again to see that we were successful:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/yourloginname/housing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group     size          modtime                                  file
1 drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup        0 2014-09-20 11:16   /yourloginname/housing/meanByCounty
2 -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup 7.683 mb 2014-09-17 11:11    /yourloginname/housing/housing.txt
</code></pre>

<p>As long as we&#39;re talking about HDFS file management, let&#39;s try out a few more functions.  Suppose
we want to make a copy of the original text file on the HDFS.  We can use the
<code>rhcp</code> function.  It takes two arguments.  The first is the source, or the directory on HDFS we 
want to copy.  The second is the target, or location for the new copy.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhcp(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/housing.txt&quot;, &quot;/yourloginname/housing/tmp/housing.txt&quot;)
rhls(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/tmp&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group     size          modtime                                   file
1 -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup 7.683 mb 2014-09-30 15:25 /yourloginname/housing/tmp/housing.txt
</code></pre>

<p>We can use <code>rhmv</code> to move the text file to a different folder.  This
function also takes two arguments, just like <code>rhcp</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhmv(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/tmp/housing.txt&quot;, &quot;/yourloginname/housing/tmp2/housing.txt&quot;)
rhls(&quot;/yourloginname/housing/&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group     size          modtime                                  file
1 drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup        0 2014-09-20 11:16        /ln/tongx/housing/meanByCounty
2 -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup 7.683 mb 2014-09-17 11:11         /ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt
3 drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup        0 2014-09-30 15:25                 /ln/tongx/housing/tmp
4 drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup        0 2014-09-30 15:28                /ln/tongx/housing/tmp2
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s enough file management.  Now let&#39;s recreate the division by state from the division by 
county, which is still on the HDFS.</p>
