## Your Installation of Packages ##

### Background ###

You will likely want to install packages on your R
session server, for example, R CRAN packages. And you want these packages to
run on the Hadoop cluster as well. The mechanism for doing this is much like
what you have been using for packages in R, but adds a push of the packages to
the cluster nodes since you will want to use them there too. It is all quite
simple.

Also, to use `RHIPE` working, packages that are needed are, obviously,
`RHIPE` from Tessera, but also `rJava` and `testthat` from R CRAN.
The second two are needed just for the
`RHIPE` installation and then are no longer needed until there is a new
installation. R becomes an issue too, because you certainly want the R
version you choose for your R session server to be the R used on the
cluster. So it needs a push to the cluster too.

Now suppose you are using RMR on the Amazon cloud, or Vagrant, both
discussed in our QuickStat section. Then installation that provides you with R
and RHIPE on the R session server and the cluster as well
has been taken care of for you. But if you want to use
R CRAN packages or packages from other sources that you install on your R
session server, then you need to know about the push mechanism to the
Hadoop cluster.

We will proceed here as if you are intalling on a R session server and Hadoop
cluster at your location that starts off with just linux and R on the R server,
and Hadoop and linux on the cluster. Part of the material is relevant for the
RMR and Vagrant users. 

Now standard R practice for a
server with many R users is for a system administator to install R for use
by all. However at the same time, you can override this with your own version.
This makes sense too for `RHIPE` and R. It makes sense to have administrators
install them on the R server and the Hadoop cluster. (The `RHIPE` installation
manual for system adminstrators is available in these pages in the QuickStart
section.)

Now there is one caution here. You are best served if the linux versions you
run are the same on the R server and cluster, and, in fact, also if the
hardware is the same. The first is more critical, but the second is a
nice bonus.  Part of the reason is that Java plays a critical roll in RHIPE,
and Java likes homogeniety.

The system administrator must also install protocol buffers on the Hadoop
cluster to enable `RHIPE` communication. This is taken up in the
installation manual. In addition, if you want to use RStudio on the
R session server,  the system administrator will need to install RStudio
server on the R session server.

### Install Packages and Push ###

Suppose you want to install `Rhipe` youself, say to get a version different
from that installed by the system administrator. To download the package,
run in your R session in your working directory

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
system("wget http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/rhipebin/Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz")
```

There are other versions of `Rhipe`. You will need to go to Github to find out
about them. To install the package on your R session server, run
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("testthat")
install.packages("rJava")
install.packages("Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```
The first two packages, are used only for `RHIPE` installation. You do not need
them again until you reinstall.

`RHIPE` is now installed. In each start up of R, to use `RHIPE` you run

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
```

Next is the push of `RHIPE` , R, and other packages to
the cluster HDFS. Part of the system administor's job is configue the HDFS so
you can do this, and other tasks where you need to write to thd HDFS.
You need to have a directory on the HDFS where you have write permission.
A common convention is for the administrator is to set up for you
the directory `/yourloginname` using the name of the login, and do the same
thing for other users. We will assume that has happened.

Suppose in `/yourloginname` you want to create a directory `packages` where you
will put the packages. You can do this are part of the push, which in this case
is

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
rhmkdir("/yourloginname/packages")
hdfs.setwd("/yourloginname/packages")
bashRhipeArchive("???")
```

`rhmkdir()` creates your directory `packages`.
hdfs.setwd()` makes this directory the location of the RHIPE commands on
on the HDFS.  bashRhipeArchive()` is creates an archive for the HDFS with a
runner script for running `RHIPE` jobs, and then uploads all
archive to the HDFS working directory that we just created "/shared/".

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE} rhls("/shared/") ``` ```
  permission owner      group     size          modtime                    file
1 -rw-rw-rw- tongx supergroup 81.02 mb 2014-06-02 15:55 /shared/RhipeLib.tar.gz
```

You can check what has been created on HDFS by using `rhls` function. There
is a "RhipeLib.tar.gz" file created under "/shared/" on HDFS. It is an
R distribution loaded with every shared lib file that a package R has
installed might have used. This tar.gz file basically included R, all R
packages user have installed on R session server, and all shared lib files
that R packages need.

Finally, every time when the user starts to use `RHIPE` package, the following
lines of commands should be called in R on R session server.

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE} library(Rhipe) rhinit()
rhoptions(zips = "/shared/RhipeLib.tar.gz") rhoptions(runner = "sh
./RhipeLib/library/Rhipe/bin/RhipeMapReduce.sh") ```
